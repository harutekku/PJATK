Kennedy lived in Brookline for the first ten years of his life and attended the local St. Aidan's Church, where he was baptized on June 19, 1917.[5][6] He was educated at the Edward Devotion School in Brookline, the Noble and Greenough Lower School in Dedham, Massachusetts, and the Dexter School (also in Brookline) through the 4th grade. JFK's earliest memories involved accompanying his grandfather Fitzgerald on walking tours of historic sites in the Boston area and discussions at the family dinner table about politics, sparking his interest in history and public service.[7][8][9] His father's business had kept him away from the family for long stretches of time, and his ventures were concentrated on Wall Street and Hollywood. In September 1927, the family moved from Boston by "private railway car" to the Riverdale neighborhood of New York City.[10][11] The family spent summers and early autumns at their home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, a village on Cape Cod, where they enjoyed swimming, sailing, and touch football.[12] Christmas and Easter holidays were at their winter retreat in Palm Beach, Florida.[13][14] Several years later, his brother Robert told Look magazine that his father had left Boston because of signs that read: "No Irish Need Apply."[15] Young John attended the Riverdale Country School−a private school for boys−from 5th to 7th grade, and was a member of Boy Scout Troop 2 in Bronxville, New York.[1][16] In September 1930, Kennedy, then 13 years old, attended the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut, for 8th grade. In April 1931, he had an appendectomy, after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated at home.[17]
